# MacOS Fork - Beginning C++ Game Programming

This is a MacOS fork of Beginning C++ Game Programming's project files.

Each project has been ported to MacOS and can be compiled with clang++.

## Getting Started

Install SFML on Mac using brew:

```bash
brew install sfml
```

To build a project, navigate to its directory and execute make.

For example:

```bash
# navigate to the chapter 1 folder
cd "Proj_01_Codes/Chapter 1/"

# execute make; look at the project's Makefile for build commands
make

# run the compiled binary
./Timber
```
